                    got my start hosting zk meetups in india for aleo — connecting devs, 
                    explaining privacy tech.
                </p>
                <p>
                    loved it, but after two years i wanted to build the stuff myself. 
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    so i learned to code and started shipping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    now it’s next.js, react, tailwind — making things that feel smooth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    building mini-apps in free time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    still fired up about privacy and community. 
                    always up for hackathons or devrel.
                </p>
